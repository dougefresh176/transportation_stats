I got these tables directly from the US Census Bureau. I once heard that reducing commute time is one of the single best things you can do for your quality of life. This got me curious about the characteristics of the average commute in America.

One thing that I confirmed is that wealthier people have a fairly normalized distribution of when they leave for work, centered around a window of 7:00 AM - 7:30 AM. Poorer people tend to leave home for their jobs in equal amounts all throughout the 24 hours of the day. This is not really surprising; many under-paying jobs also have difficult work hours.
